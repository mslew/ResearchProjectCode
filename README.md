## Abstract

<strong> An Agent-Based Model of Environmental Transmission of C. difficile in Healthcare Settings </strong>

<em>Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)</em> is one of the most frequently identified healthcare-acquired infections in United States hospitals. Colonized patients, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, shed <em>C. difficile</em> endospores that can survive for long periods on surfaces outside the host and are resistant to many commonly-used disinfectants. Transmission pathways can include contact with endospores on fomites, objects likely to carry infection. 

This project will investigate the relative contribution of environmental pathways to <em>C. difficile</em> transmission in healthcare settings using an agent-based model (ABM). Our model simulates the spread of <em>C. difficile</em> within a hospital while focusing on frequently-touched surfaces in each hospital room. Simulations allow us to examine the role that surfaces with varying touch frequencies play in patient colonization and determine effective control strategies to mitigate the spread of <em>C. difficile</em> in healthcare settings.
